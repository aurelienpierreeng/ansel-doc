"Library\n"
": The library toolbox, in the left sidebar, provides the primary querying criteria to extract a subset of images from the library database. The main criteria are :\n"
"    - __Folders__ : the base folder in which the images are stored on your filesystem. They can be shown as a flat list or as a tree. Note that Ansel does not directly read the folder's content, but shows its [imported](../../getting-started/import.md) images (from its database) whose base folder matches this criterion. As such, the actual filesystem folder may contain more images than what Ansel will show, if they have not been imported.\n"
"    - __Collections__ : allows to query all images that have a certain tag assigned. This is similar to what other software call \"collections\" or \"virtual folders\", except that, in Ansel, you don't add an image to a virtual folder, you assign a tag to an image, and then query all images having that tag.\n"
"    - __Queries__ : enables more advanced querying rules, using metadata and boolean combinations of criteria (or/and/and not). Note that _folders_ and _collections_ (aka _tags_) only provide a simplified interface for the most common fields that can be found in the _queries_ tab. Available metadata to filter can be:\n"
"        - __gear__ : lens name, camera, focal length,\n"
"        - __exposure settings__ : shutterspeed, ISO, aperture,\n"
"        - __date and time__ : of the shot, of last modification, last export, last print, etc.\n"
"        - __user set data__ : title, description, copyright, creator, publisher, etc.\n"
"        - __internal technical tags__ : file format, local copies, etc.\n"

"            - to select images rated at least 3 stars, you will need to select the third, fourth and fifth stars, which can be quickly achieved with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>left click</kbd> on the third star.\n"
"    - __color labels__ :\n"

"    - __edited state__ :\n"

"        - images having an editing history : the yin-yang +/- circle (same as on the thumbnails),\n"
"    - __selection__ : restricting the collection to any arbitrary user-defined selection. This replaces Darktable's _culling_ view.\n"
"    - __text search__ : restricting the collection to all images having at least one textual property matching the search query (filename, folder, title, etc.).\n"
": The controls from the _include_ toolbar are toggle buttons, meaning when they are selected, images matching those criteria will be shown (filtered in/included), and when they are unselected, images matching those criteria will be hidden (filtered out/excluded). To show everything (_include everything_ or _exclude nothing_), you will therefore need to have all buttons checked, which can be quickly achieved by doing a right click on any of the buttons, then selecting _Select all filters_ in the context menu.

msgid "When an image is sent to a display device, each pixel is normally represented as a set of 3 numbers, representing the intensity of the red, green and blue primary colors in the output color space. Because the output color space is usually closely related to hardware with physical limations, there is a maximum permitted value for the [R,G,B] channels, representing the maximum available intensity for that color space. Similarly, there is also a minimum value below which pixel values will be mapped to zero. When we try to convert from a larger color space to the final output color space, any values exceeding this maximum will be clamped to the maximum value, and any values below the minimum will be clamped to zero. This process is called \"clipping\" and it will lead to lost detail, or \"incorrect\" colors for any pixels with clipped channels.\n"

This mode is also known as the \"over\" Porter-Duff alpha blending operator (see [alpha compositing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing) for more details).\n"

": This blend mode is the same as “normal”, except that the input and output data are clamped to a particular min/max value range. Out-of-range values are effectively blocked and are not passed to subsequent modules. Sometimes this helps to prevent artifacts. However, in most cases (e.g. highly color-saturated extreme highlights) it is better to let unbound values travel through the pixelpipe to be properly handled later. The “normal” blend mode is therefore usually preferred.\n"

The “mask opacity” slider allows you to readjust the mask opacity to compensate. If the mask opacity is decreased (negative slider values) less opaque parts are affected more strongly. Conversely, if the mask opacity is increased (positive slider values) more opaque parts are affected more strongly. As a consequence, completely opaque portions of the mask always remain opaque and completely transparent portions always remain transparent.

": In-camera, it is recommended that you use a technique known as \"Expose To The Right\" (ETTR). This means exposing the shot so that the exposure is as bright as possible without clipping the highlights. It is called \"exposing to the right\" because the in-camera histogram should be touching all the way up to the right hand side without peaking at the right hand side (which could indicate clipping). This technique ensures you make maximum use of the dynamic range of your camera's sensor.\n"

msgid ": The default auto-exposure metering mode in your camera will normally expose the image so that the average brightness in the image tends towards middle-gray. Sometimes, for scenes dominated by light tones, the camera will underexpose the image to bring those light tones more towards middle-gray. For scenes dominated by dark tones, it may over-expose the image and end up clipping the highlights. In such cases you can use the exposure compensation dial in your camera to raise or lower the exposure -- the Ansel exposure module can automatically take this into account when processing your image.\n"

The settings for this feature are on the [_reconstruct_](#reconstruct) tab. Some cameras also offer a \"highlight priority\" exposure metering mode that can help to maximise exposure while protecting the highlights, and many offer features such as \"zebras\" or \"blinkies\" in the live view to alert the photographer when parts of the image are being clipped.\n"

This case is a numerical oddity that matches no physical reality (a pixel with no luminance should have no chromaticity either), will produce a division by zero in xyY and Yuv color spaces, and will create `NaN` RGB values as a result. This issue is **not** corrected inside _color calibration_ because it is a symptom of a bad input profiling and/or a bad black point level, and needs to be addressed manually either by adjusting the input color profile with the channel mixer or in the _exposure_ module's _black level correction_.\n"

msgid "Channel mixing is a process that defines a boosting/muting factor for each channel as a ratio of all the original channels. Instead of entering a single flat correction that ties the output value of a channel to its input value (for example, `R_output = R_input × correction`), the correction to each channel is dependent on the input of _all_ of the channels for each pixel (for example, `R_output = R_input × R_correction + G_input × G_correction + B_input × B_correction`). Thus a pixel's channels contribute to each other (a process known as \"cross-talk\") which is equivalent to rotating the primary colors of the color space in 3D. This is, in effect, digital simulation of physical color filters.\n"

Also, since RGB tristimulus does not decouple luminance and chrominance, but is an additive lighting setup, the \"G\" channel is more strongly tied to human luminance perception than the \"R\" and \"B\" ones. All pixels have a non-zero G channel, which implies that any correction to the G channel is likely to affect all pixels.\n"

Unfortunately, there is no way to find out what the resource limits are for a given device, so Ansel uses a very conservative guess of 128 by default. On most current devices and drivers you can expect a number of up to 1024 to be safe and lead to slightly better OpenCL performance.

"[The tethering view](https://docs.darktable.org/usermanual/3.8/en/tethering/)\n"
": It relies on the lib GPhoto2 which is super brittle and buggy. The tethering view is merely a GUI over Gphoto2, much like [Entangle](https://entangle-photo.org/). The problem is GPhoto2 is known to break something different at each new release, so it's simply not worth the trouble to maintain a GUI over a Schrödinger cat. Use Entangle if you need to.\n"

": That thing is coded by copy-pasting the display code, instead of writing reusable functions. It wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't completely misleading and actually broke the over-exposure alert (because, yes, it's used there too). Because the histogram is captured at the far end of the pipeline, in display color space, it might be already clipped to display gamut. Say you use Rec2020 space as the histogram profile, because it's the working space, what you see is RGB clipped to display space then rescaled to Rec2020, which means your clipping peak will not be at the far end of the graph, where you expect it. The result is highly misleading and voids the whole principle of a scope. That's just a whole pile of crap coded by people who have no idea of what a graphic pipeline is and hack small bits here and there because the concept of \"modules\" fooled them. They might be modular, but they still apply in sequence in the pipeline, so better check your inputs.\n"

That backfired badly because users don't get the difference between an error and an alert, so even when instructed to use 2 white balances (for example, a custom-corrected raw WB), they would get afraid by the \"error\" and annoy me with questions. Given that this feature is clearly not helping anybody, and did not trigger the expected behaviour (that is, RTFM), there is no point in keeping it. The option to hide them is removed as well.\n"

"Importing from camera\n"
": darktable has a way to mount the camera file system (SD or CF memory cards) through USB, using the library GPhoto2. But the desktop environment is also be able to mount the camera as a local hard drive using PTP and/or MTP protocol, possibly also through Gphoto2. In that case, darktable and the OS may compete for access to the USB media, so you need to unmount it first from the OS to be able to open it from darktable. On Windows, you even need to install custom USB drivers to make it work with GPhoto2, but these drivers will prevent the camera to work with the OS until you completly remove and reset them. So this feature is completely removed, and Ansel loads memory cards as USB media through the OS mounts. To enable this, you may have to install Linux packages such as `libmtp`, `linuxptp`, `libptp`, `libgphoto2` and possibly `gphoto2`. For your desktop environnment, you may install `kio-mtp` and `kio-extras` on KDE or `gvfs-mtp` and `gvfs-gphoto2` on Gnome. In any case, you are advised to simply use an SD of CF card reader, it's cheap and prevents most issues that can arise from udev and cameras connected through USB.\n"

"Keyboard shortcuts\n"
": The great MIDI input thingy of 2021 broke basic functionality and user expectations : the numeric pad events did not listen to the state of `numlock` and were always recorded as `Home`, `End`, `PageDown` etc. Also, on AZERTY and BÉPO keyboards, the regular number keys are accessed through `Shift`. This broke the picture ratings because numbers from the numeric pad were not recorded as numbers, and the regular numbers did nothing. When reconfiguring the rating shortcuts with regular numbers, you would then see things like `Shift + &` on AZERTY or `Shift + \"` on BÉPO, instead of the expected `1`.\n"
": Then, to get the numpad numbers to work, you had to manually add them as alternative shortcuts. That's a backstep of more than 25 years regarding UI, all because the MIDI developer thought it was clever to disregard OS key mapping and handle it internally. This has been fixed in a way that gets the OS-decoded key (including modifiers like `Shift` and `numlock` when needed), and then remaps all numpad key strokes to regular key strokes, so the `Enter`, `*`, `/`, `Delete` and all the numeric keys will be treated equally no matter where they are input, without having to duplicate shortcuts for the numpad. It is crazy that this should be announced as a new feature in 2023 and is another proof that darktable development went south thanks to die-hard geeks.\n"
