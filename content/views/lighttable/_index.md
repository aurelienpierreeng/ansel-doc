The lighttable view allows you to view and manage your image collection.

The centre view contains thumbnails of your images -- how they are displayed depends on which [mode](./lighttable-modes/_index.md) you are working in.

While images are selected, there are a number of actions you can perform with keyboard shortcuts:

- `F1, F2, F3, F4, F5` adds or removes a color label (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, respectively). A color label will be added if _any_ selected image does not currently have the label; otherwise the label will be removed

- `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5` sets the star rating

- `R` rejects the image(s)

- `Ctrl+N` creates new development

- `Ctrl+D` duplicates existing development

- `Ctrl+C` copies development

- `Ctrl+V` pastes development (all)

- `Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes development (parts)

- `Enter` opens the image in the darkroom view for developing
