The Slideshow view is optional and needs to be activated in [Preferences > Other views](../../preferences-settings/other-views.md). It allows you to watch a slideshow of your current collection with the associated filtering rules and sort order applied.

To learn more about how to define the collection and filtering rules, see the section on [collections](../lighttable/digital-asset-management/collections.md). Select the sort criteria and sort order of the images in the [Top panel](../../overview/user-interface/top-panel.md).

The next section provides more details on the [usage](usage.md) of the Slideshow view.
