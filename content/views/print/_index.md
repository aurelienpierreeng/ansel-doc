The Print view is optional and needs to be activated in [Preferences > Other views](../../preferences-settings/other-views.md). This view allows you to print your images. Because printing is not easy, there are many technical aspects to be taken into account.

After selecting an image in the [Lighttable view](../lighttable/_index.md) you can enter the [Print settings](../../modules/utility-modules/print/print-settings.md) module to adjust printer settings and initiate printing.

This module supports the printer's ICC profile, which is somewhat mandatory if you want to obtain a high quality print close to the image displayed on the screen.

It is important to note that ICC profiles provided by the paper and/or printer manufacturers cannot be used on GNU/Linux as they are printer-driver dependent. The Ansel print module uses CUPS and there are no ready-to-use ICC profiles available for this driver.
